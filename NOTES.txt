CH 2.3
In node, if you take a variable, then put a period and then press TAB, you will get a list of all the methods and properties available!
(I didn't get that to work in chrome console, though) 

CH 3.2
Making a COPY (rather than just a reference) of an OBJECT in JS is tricky.

To do it, we can do these things:

USE THE SPREAD OPERATOR
cat2 = { ...cat1 }

JSON
let cat3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(cat1))

OBJECT.ASSIGN
let cat4 = Object.assign({},cat1)


The Object.assign() static method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the modified target object.

This last way works like this:
const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source = { b: 4, c: 5 };

const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

console.log(target);
// Expected output: Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }

console.log(returnedTarget === target);
// Expected output: true


CH 3.7
END
Push: adds element to end of Array
  counties.push("Dublin")
Pop: takes element from end of Array.|
  counties.pop()

FRONT
Unshift: adds to front of Array
  counties.unshift("Monaghan")
Shift: takes first item from Array
  counties.shift()

Note: these methods RETURN values, but they also MODIFY the original arrays

TO REMOVE AN ELEMENT FROM MIDDLE OF Array
splice(index, number of items to remove)
counties.splice(2, 4)


REGULAR EXPRESSIONS ==================
Here are a bunch of strings....

var string1 = "This is the longest string ever.";
var string2 = "This is the shortest string ever.";
var string3 = "Is this the thing called Mount Everest?";
var string4 = "This is the Sherman on the Mount.";

Here is our regular expression. Putting / / at front and back 
creates a regular expression.
var regex = /this/;

With that variation, use its test method.
Pass a string to the method and it will see if the regular 
expression appears within the string.

The only one here that returns TRUE is string3. The other 
uses of the word "this" do not qualify because of case. However,
in string three, there is a lower case THIS.

regex.test(string1);
regex.test(string2);
regex.test(string3);
regex.test(string4);

Make it case insensitive. This will make all TRUE.
regex = /this/i;

Caret at beginning means match against the beginning of the string.
So here, 1,2, and 4 will be true, because those sentences 
start with the expression (this) we are looking for.

regex = /^this/i;

Putting a $ at end means test at the end of the string. 
This will make all four FALSE.
regex = /this$/i;

This will return true for 1 & 2 because "ever" appears 
at the end of the sentence. A DOT here means "any character",
which includes the period, but not literally. 

regex = /ever.$/i;

This will return true for 1 & 2 because "ever." appears 
at the end of the sentence. Here we have escaped the DOT, so 
it means a literaly dot, not "any character".

regex = /ever\.$/i;
